Antfarm-io is an open source investigation into the social production practices of human beings. 

We leverage the vast resources and infrastructure of GitHub to create a virtual colony of interconnected units—individual GitHub accounts, which we call "social production pods"—in order to gain a better understanding of how social production happens at both the individual and collective levels. 

Rather than being an idle experiment, we aim to acquire this understanding through the practice of social production itself. Participants operate under the mandate of creating a [sustainable society](https://www.britannica.com/science/sustainability#ref1225913)—i.e., one "in which the environmental and economic actions taken by present persons do not diminish the opportunities of future persons to enjoy similar levels of wealth, utility, or welfare." This means taking on some of the world's biggest challenges, including climate change, systemic injustice and inequity, and extreme poverty. 

In pursuing this goal, we aim to build a community that functions as more than the sum of its parts and can serve as a model of what the society of the future might become.

> “Commons-based peer production is a term coined by Harvard Law School professor Yochai Benkler. It describes a new model of socioeconomic production in which large numbers of people work cooperatively (usually over the Internet). Commons-based projects generally have less rigid hierarchical structures than those under more traditional business models. Often—but not always—commons-based projects are designed without a need for financial compensation for contributors. 
The term is often used interchangeably with the term social production.” [(Peer-Production. Wikipedia)](https://wiki.p2pfoundation.net/Peer_Production.)

> “Social production of habitat is an international term used to convey the process and product arising from the experience of people in a community collectively determining the conditions of their own habitat (dwelling place and living environment). Social production is found when people take the initiative to pose solutions to the problems arising from their living conditions. Partners in social production can be informal groups or local organizations, and/or other actors external to the community, such as NGOs, donors, private sector enterprises, cooperatives[1], professional associations, academics or government institutions, or any combination of these. Social production is usually characterized by a large measure of voluntary action and people’s agency.

> In economic terms, social production involves people at the community level relying on them collectively to identify, exploit and increase local capital as assets in the development process.

> From a social perspective, social production is a process (and product) that identifies exploits and further develops relationships within the community on an equitable basis.

> From a human rights perspective, social production means collective action to satisfy human needs and, thus, realize human rights consistent with prevailing concepts of human dignity and fairness.” [(Social Production of Habitat.

## Introduction
When the individual behaviors of social insects become so tightly synchronized that the collective begins to exhibit seemingly intelligent or purposeful behavior as an emergent property, the colony is referred to as a superorganism [(Superorganism. Wikipedia.)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superorganism). Some have speculated that in order for human beings to gain power over the biggest problems that threaten us today—including climate change, systemic injustice and inequity, and pandemics—they too must learn to coordinate their behavior in a similarly harmonious fashion. Such problems were created through collective action, and so must be remedied through collective action.

The social insects accomplish this feat through blind mechanisms evolved through natural selection—[chemical messengers]() passed between individuals or left in the environment, or [elaborate dances](). 

In the absence of chemical stimuli to , we must rely on technologies of our own devising. One promising

> "A superorganism \[...] is a group of synergetically interacting organisms of the same species. The term /[...] is used most often to describe a social unit of eusocial animals, where division of labour is highly specialised and where individuals are not able to survive by themselves for extended periods. \[...] A superorganism can be defined as "a collection of agents which can act in concert to produce phenomena governed by the collective", phenomena being any activity "the hive wants" such as ants collecting food and avoiding predators, or bees choosing a new nest site. Superorganisms tend to exhibit homeostasis, power law scaling, persistent disequilibrium and emergent behaviours." [(Superorganism. Wikipedia.)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superorganism)

> "Collective action refers to action taken together by a group of people whose goal is to enhance their status and achieve a common objective." [(Collective Action. Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_action)

> "A collective action problem or social dilemma is a situation in which all individuals would be better off cooperating but fail to do so because of conflicting interests between individuals that discourage joint action. Problems arise when too many group members choose to pursue individual profit and immediate satisfaction rather than behave in the group's best long-term interests. \[...] The collective action problem can be understood through the analysis of game theory and the free-rider problem, which results from the provision of public goods. Additionally, the collective problem can be applied to numerous public policy concerns that countries across the world currently face." [(Collective Action Problem.

## Goals and objectives
The goal of the exercise is to achieve a sustainable colony. Sustainability is meant to serve as a sort of value-neutral framework for guiding the activities of our users without imposing too narrow restrictions on the precise means (values, beliefs, policies) they employ to get there. 

Sustainability consists of the following component objectives:
1. Sufficiency of essential resources, including:
- Funds
- Contributors (stable population)
- 
2. 

If any of these objectives fail to be met, the colony collapses and the experiment is concluded. After a collapse, the experiment can be reset with a new cohort of participants. 

## Methodology

*Project components*

1. Antfarm.io - The main platform through which we conduct our investigation. 
2. Antfarm-project repository - This repository represents the colony itself, which is cooperatively maintained by all participants through the submission of pull requests. This project consists primarily of governance tools, project resources, work products, and documentation.
- 
3. Colony
The colony is made up of 4 castes:
1. Larvae
2. Workers
3. Soldiers
4. Queens

4. Task sets
Task sets are the discrete tasks 

5. 


## Project phases
The project is designed to progress through two main stages: a research phase and a project phase.  

*Research Phase*
During the research phase of the project, 

Even once the project phase has commenced, the research phase continues in a parallel trajectory. 

*Project Phase*
During the Project Phase, the project will open to outside parties to submit project proposals to be adopted by future cohorts as task sets. Only members that have completed 3 or more task sets at the Research Phase level will be eligible to apply to a client-sponsored project.

## How it works
By participating in this study, you assume the role of both subject and investigator. In your role as subject, you agree to host your social production projects on the [Antfarm-io home account](github.com/antfarm-io/) and contribute to the maintenance of the colony by submitting pull requests on the Antfarm-project repository. 

In your role as investigator, you glean insights from your local network (comprising your own projects and those you contribute to) and feed them back into the [main repository](github.com/antfarm-io/antfarm-project) to be leveraged toward the improvement of the colony (i.e. the main platform, antfarm-io.).

1. Apply to be a member of a cohort.

Cohorts are the primary vehicle by which the goals of the colony are furthered. Each cohort has a predefined capacity ranging from 4-200 members. Each cohort is assigned a specific task set they are execpted to complete within the allotted time frame. 

Anyone can apply to be a member of a cohort and no special qualifications are required. Selections are made randomly to prevent discrimination. Each member of the cohort is expected to contribute between 15 minutes (for small tasks) and 4 hours (for large tasks) a day on the task set. 

When you apply, a profile will be created for you giving you access to other opportunities across the platform. Our selection 

New cohorts are formed on a rolling basis so that you never have to wait and have overlapping work periods. 

3. 

4. Connect your GitHub account to this one, becoming part of the colony.

Clone the Antfarm.io repository into your personal GitHub account. 

5. Add your social production projects' repositories to the Antfarm-io home account.

These projects and their associated project files serve as a living laboratory for the improvement of the colony. 

6. Data generated by your activity on these projects is collected and stored in the Insights tab of the Antfarm-io home account.

## Deliverables
Each work cycle (or sprint) should yield the following minimum outputs:

1. Documentation of the group's activities, including assigned roles, datasets and other resources used, and methods and analyses employed. (A template will be provided by the cohort's staff advisor)
2. A [retrospective](https://searchsoftwarequality.techtarget.com/definition/Agile-retrospective), in which the team reflects on what happened in the iteration and identifies actions for improvement going forward.
3. Products satisfying the requirements of the task set.
