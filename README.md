Antfarm-io is an open source investigation into the social production practices of human beings. 

We leverage the vast resources and infrastructure of GitHub to create a virtual colony of interconnected units—individual GitHub accounts, which we call "social production pods"—in order to gain a better understanding of how social production happens at both the individual and collective levels. 

Rather than being an idle experiment, we aim to acquire this understanding through the practice of social production itself. Participants operate under the mandate of creating a [sustainable society](https://www.britannica.com/science/sustainability#ref1225913)—i.e., one "in which the environmental and economic actions taken by present persons do not diminish the opportunities of future persons to enjoy similar levels of wealth, utility, or welfare." This means taking on some of the world's biggest challenges, including climate change, systemic injustice and inequity, and extreme poverty. 

In pursuing this goal, we aim to build a community that functions as more than the sum of its parts and can serve as a model of what the society of the future might become.

## Introduction
When the individual behaviors of social insects become so tightly synchronized that the collective begins to exhibit seemingly intelligent or purposeful behavior as an emergent property, the colony is referred to as a superorganism [(Superorganism. Wikipedia.)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superorganism). Some have speculated that in order for human beings to gain power over the biggest problems that threaten us today—including climate change, systemic injustice and inequity, and pandemics—they too must learn to coordinate their behavior in a similarly harmonious fashion. Such problems were created through collective action, and so must be remedied through collective action.

The social insects accomplish this feat through blind mechanisms evolved through natural selection—[chemical messengers]() passed between individuals or left in the environment, or [elaborate dances](). Ants, for instance, use [(Wikiepedia. )](. In the absence of chemical stimuli to guide and coordinate our collective activity, we humans must rely on technologies of our own devising.

One promising approach is to employ nudges, positive reinforcement and indirect suggestions that influence the behavior and decision making of groups or individuals without diminishing their capacity for free choice.[Nudge Theory. Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nudge_theory). Such interventions can be deployed either as policies (via a prcess known as ["choice architecture"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choice_architecture#:~:text=Choice%20architecture%20is%20the%20design,presentation%20on%20consumer%20decision%2Dmaking.)) or as features of the physical environment, as when we paint a room in a calming color to promote faster recovery from a or manipulate the placement or a product to catch our eye.

> Thaler's "Nudge" is the alternative, assuming people will act in their self-interest without depending or using rationality or reason. Thaler shows in his reserach and presents in his book how to shape choice using the newly discovered laws of predictable irrationality, or choice shaping.

The theory works because of how humans evolved. Many of the undesirable consequences of our behavior in are [just a byproduct of our pleistocene brains trying to navigate a foreign environment - like moths drawn to a flame] a consequence of our pleistocene brains struggling to adapt to a 21st-century globalized, technologized environment. We struggle to grasp the meaning of tragedies affecting millions, so  fail to feel the appropriate outrage 

By leveraging nudge theory, we can start patching one by one those features of our modern environment that trip us up, helping us behave in more [ecologically rational](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/ecological-rationality#:~:text=The%20term%20'ecological%20rationality'%20refers,to%20succeed%20in%20that%20environment) ways.

This vision is broader than simply moving everyone into biophiphilic cities. Greening our environment has been shown to reduce anxiety and increase productivity, but it's hardly a complete solution. The concept of a smart environment 

While humans can't hope to solve their collective action problems with pheremones, we can make specific changes to our environment to help us to mitigate the most damaging effects of .

## Goals and objectives
I just want a bunch of networked entities (individual people, informal groups, organizations and companies) working under the same umbrella, i.e., on the same broad platform, and expanding and improving the infrastructure that they commonly rely on so that they can operate at a similar - or even higher - capacity than the capitalist market economy they’re trying to replace. I want to consolidate these resources, remodel them as a single unified system, build that system, and put them back to work. So I really should be asking myself more often than I do - what’s the shortest path to achieving that goal? 

## Project phases
The project is designed to progress through two main stages: a research phase and a project phase.  

*Research Phase*
During the research phase of the project, 

Even once the project phase has commenced, the research phase continues in a parallel trajectory. 

*Project Phase*
During the Project Phase, the project will open to outside parties to submit project proposals to be adopted by future cohorts as task sets. Only members that have completed 3 or more task sets at the Research Phase level will be eligible to apply to a client-sponsored project.

## How it works
By participating in this study, you assume the role of both subject and investigator. In your role as subject, you agree to host your social production projects on the [Antfarm-io home account](github.com/antfarm-io/) and contribute to the maintenance of the colony by submitting pull requests on the Antfarm-project repository. 

In your role as investigator, you glean insights from your local network (comprising your own projects and those you contribute to) and feed them back into the [main repository](github.com/antfarm-io/antfarm-project) to be leveraged toward the improvement of the colony (i.e. the main platform, antfarm-io.).

1. Apply to be a member of a cohort.

Cohorts are the primary vehicle by which the goals of the colony are furthered. Each cohort has a predefined capacity ranging from 4-200 members. Each cohort is assigned a specific task set they are execpted to complete within the allotted time frame. 

Anyone can apply to be a member of a cohort and no special qualifications are required. Selections are made randomly to prevent discrimination. Each member of the cohort is expected to contribute between 15 minutes (for small tasks) and 4 hours (for large tasks) a day on the task set. 

When you apply, a profile will be created for you giving you access to other opportunities across the platform. Our selection 

New cohorts are formed on a rolling basis so that you never have to wait and have overlapping work periods. 

3. 

4. Connect your GitHub account to this one, becoming part of the colony.

Clone the Antfarm.io repository into your personal GitHub account. 

5. Add your social production projects' repositories to the Antfarm-io home account.

These projects and their associated project files serve as a living laboratory for the improvement of the colony. 

6. Data generated by your activity on these projects is collected and stored in the Insights tab of the Antfarm-io home account.

Prior to enrolling at CMU, he worked for approximately eight years in a wide variety of positions in the areas of environmental science and conservation. His early career was devoted primarily to addressing water quality issues in his home state of Florida, where he worked as an environmental consultant in support of several projects managed by the local Water Management Districts. During this time, he gained a lot of valuable experience both in water quality and other field sampling techniques as well as in the broader policy environment surrounding the local management of natural resources.<br />

His primary research interests focus on how online crowdsourcing platforms may be used to support collective action-style solutions to high-complexity problems like climate change.<br />
