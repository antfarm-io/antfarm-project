# Welcome to the Antfarm Project
The Antfarm Project is an open source investigation into the social production practices of human beings. 

We leverage the vast resources and infrastructure of GitHub to create a virtual colony of interconnected units - individual GitHub accounts, which we call "social production pods" - in order to gain a better understanding of how social production happens at both the individual and collective levels. 

Rather than being an idle experiment, we aim to acquire this understanding through the practice of social production itself. Participants operate under the mandate that they are to work together to create the sort of world they wish to live in. This means taking on some of the world's biggest challenges, including climate change, systemic injustice and inequity, and extreme poverty. In pursuing this goal, we aim to build a community that functions as more than the sum of its parts and can provide a model of what the society of the future might become. 

**Some useful definitions**

> “Commons-based peer production is a term coined by Harvard Law School professor Yochai Benkler. It describes a new model of socioeconomic production in which large numbers of people work cooperatively (usually over the Internet). Commons-based projects generally have less rigid hierarchical structures than those under more traditional business models. Often—but not always—commons-based projects are designed without a need for financial compensation for contributors. 
The term is often used interchangeably with the term social production.” [(Peer-Production. Wikipedia)](https://wiki.p2pfoundation.net/Peer_Production.)

> “Social production of habitat is an international term used to convey the process and product arising from the experience of people in a community collectively determining the conditions of their own habitat (dwelling place and living environment). Social production is found when people take the initiative to pose solutions to the problems arising from their living conditions. Partners in social production can be informal groups or local organizations, and/or other actors external to the community, such as NGOs, donors, private sector enterprises, cooperatives[1], professional associations, academics or government institutions, or any combination of these. Social production is usually characterized by a large measure of voluntary action and people’s agency.
> In economic terms, social production involves people at the community level relying on them collectively to identify, exploit and increase local capital as assets in the development process.
> From a social perspective, social production is a process (and product) that identifies exploits and further develops relationships within the community on an equitable basis.
> From a human rights perspective, social production means collective action to satisfy human needs and, thus, realize human rights consistent with prevailing concepts of human dignity and fairness.” [(Social Production of Habitat.

## Introduction
When the individual behaviors of social insects become so tightly syncronized that the collective begins to exhibit seemingly intelligent behavior as an emergent property, the colony is referred to as a superorganism [1](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/27856005.pdf?seq=1). Some have speculated that in order for human beings to gain power over many of the biggest problems that threaten us today - including climate change, systemic injustice and inequity, and pandemics - they too must learn to coordinate their behavior in a similarly harmonious fashion. These problems were created by the wrong sort of collective action, and must be remedied by replacing it with the right sort.

The social insects accomplish this feat through blind mechanisms evolved through natural selection - [chemical messengers]() passed between individuals or left in the environment, or [elaborate dances]().

## Goals and objectives
The goal of the exercise is to achieve a sustainable colony. Sustainability is meant to serve as a sort of value-neutral framework for guiding the activities of our users without imposing too narrow restrictions on the precise means (values, beliefs, policies) they employ to get there. 

Sustainability consists of the following component objectives:
1. Sufficiency of essential resources, including:
- Funds
- Contributors (stable population)
- 
2. 

If any of these objectives fail to be met, the colony collapses and the experiment is concluded. After a collapse, the experiment can be reset with a new cohort of participants. 

## Methodology
1. Antfarm.io - The main platform through which we conduct our investigation. Also referred to as the colony. 
2. Antfarm-project repository - This repository represents the colony itself, which is cooperatively maintained by all participants through the submission of pull requests. This project consists primarily of governance tools and documentation.

## How it works
By participating in this study, you assume the role of both subject and investigator. In your role as subject, you agree to host your social production projects on the [Antfarm-io home account](github.com/antfarm-io/) and contribute to the maintenance of the colony by submitting pull requests on the Antfarm-project repository.

In your role as investigator, you glean insights from your local network (comprising your own projects and those you contribute to) and feed them back into the [main repository](github.com/antfarm-io/antfarm-project) to be leveraged toward the improvement of the colony (i.e. the main platform, antfarm-io.).

1. Connect your GitHub account to this one, becoming part of the colony.

Clone the Antfarm.io repository into your personal GitHub account. 

2. Add your social production projects' repositories to the Antfarm-io home account.

These projects and their associated project files serve as a living laboratory for the improvement of the colony. 

3. Data generated by your activity on these projects is collected and stored in the Insights tab of the Antfarm-io home account. 

## Rules
We don't dictate 

However, we do encourage our participants to consider various factors and require them to document their decisions regarding these factors. These articles of incorporation will be filed with main 

(Alternatively, we could take a no holds barred approach and derive these patterns from the insights generated by them. But since there is an explicit goal to this activity, it makes sense that we should approach this intentionally and incorporate best practices based on the research to date.)

Patrick Campbell holds a B.S. in Biology from Palm Beach Atlantic University, an M.A. in Philosophy from Northern Illinois University, and a M.S. in Public Policy and Mangement from Carnegie Mellon University. Prior to enrolling at CMU, I worked for approximately eight years in a wide variety of positions in the areas of environmental science and conservation. My early career was devoted primarily to addressing water quality issues in my home state of Florida, where I worked as an environmental consultant in support of several projects managed by the local Water Management Districts. During this time, I gained a lot of valuable experience both in water quality and other field sampling techniques as well as in the broader policy environment surrounding the local management of natural resources.

His primary research interests focus on how online crowdsourcing platforms may be used to support collective action-style solutions to high-complexity problems like climate change.
