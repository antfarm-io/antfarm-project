# Welcome to the Antfarm Project
The Antfarm Project is an open source investigation into the social production practices of human beings. 

> “Commons-based peer production is a term coined by Harvard Law School professor Yochai Benkler. It describes a new model of socioeconomic production in which large numbers of people work cooperatively (usually over the Internet). Commons-based projects generally have less rigid hierarchical structures than those under more traditional business models. Often—but not always—commons-based projects are designed without a need for financial compensation for contributors. 
The term is often used interchangeably with the term social production.” [Peer-Production. Wikipedia](https://wiki.p2pfoundation.net/Peer_Production.)

> “Social production of habitat is an international term used to convey the process and product arising from the experience of people in a community collectively determining the conditions of their own habitat (dwelling place and living environment). Social production is found when people take the initiative to pose solutions to the problems arising from their living conditions. Partners in social production can be informal groups or local organizations, and/or other actors external to the community, such as NGOs, donors, private sector enterprises, cooperatives[1], professional associations, academics or government institutions, or any combination of these. Social production is usually characterized by a large measure of voluntary action and people’s agency.
> In economic terms, social production involves people at the community level relying on them collectively to identify, exploit and increase local capital as assets in the development process.
> From a social perspective, social production is a process (and product) that identifies exploits and further develops relationships within the community on an equitable basis.
> From a human rights perspective, social production means collective action to satisfy human needs and, thus, realize human rights consistent with prevailing concepts of human dignity and fairness.” [Social Produection of Habitat.

We leverage the vast resources and infrastructure of GitHub to create a virtual colony of interconnected units - individual GitHub accounts, which we call "social production pods" - in order to both practice and gain a better understanding of how social production happens at both the individual as well as collective level. 

Rather than being an idle experiment, we aim to .  

...which come together to function as more than the sum of its parts.

This investigation builds on previous studies into the social production potential of digital commons [bibliography]() and attempts to successfully utilize . 

## Introduction
When the individual behaviors of social insects become so tightly syncronized that the collective begins to exhibit seemingly intelligent behavior as an emergent property, the colony is referred to as a superorganism [1](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/27856005.pdf?seq=1). Some have speculated that in order for human beings to gain power over [many of the biggest problems that threaten us today] collective action problems, they too must learn to coordinate their behavior in a similarly harmonious fashion.

The social insects accomplish this feat through blind mechanisms evolved through natural selection - [chemical messengers]() passed between individuals or left in the environment, or [elaborate dances](). 
In the absence of chemical stimuli to , we must rely on technologies of our own devising. One promising

## Elements of the experiment
1. Antfarm.io - The main platform through which we conduct our investigation. Also referred to as the colony.
2. Antfarm-project repository - This repository represents the colony itself, which is cooperatively maintained by all participants through the submission of pull requests.

## How it works
By participating, you assume the role of both subject and investigator. In your role as subject, you agree to host your social production projects on the [Antfarm-io home account](github.com/antfarm-io/) and contribute to the maintenance of the colony by submitting pull requests on the Antfarm-project repository.

In your role as investigator, you glean insights from your local network (comprising your own projects and those you contribute to) and feed them back into the [main repository](github.com/antfarm-io/antfarm-project) to be leveraged toward the improvement of the colony (i.e. the main platform, antfarm-io.).

1. Connect your GitHub account to this one, becoming part of the colony.

Clone the Antfarm.io repository into your personal GitHub account. 

2. Add your social production projects' repositories to the Antfarm-io home account.

These projects and their associated project files serve as a living laboratory for the improvement of the colony. 

3. Data generated by your activity on these projects is collected and stored in the Insights tab of the Antfarm-io home account.
